This source code estimates degree for Trivium. 

This code is written by C++. 

You need to change some options in Makefile according to your operating system.

Then you just run
+++
 make
+++

After compile, if you want to try the degree evaluation of cube $I_1$ or $I_5$(refer to the paper) for 840-round or 841-round Trivium, you just run
+++
	./a.out -i[1 or 5] -r [840 or 841] -m [mode: 1 or 2]
+++

Note that we use "int8_t"(-128 -- 127) to store the degree to save memory space. If the degree is greater than 100, we suggest that you replace â€œint8_t" with "int16_t" or other integer type.
